# Validators

We’re kicking off our first release with a miner-only rollout. This phased approach allows us to identify and resolve any potential issues before moving to a full network release within the next 24–48 hours.

### Validator Release Timeline
Detailed instructions for running your own validator will be provided within 48 hours. In the meantime, we will operate a single validator to closely monitor the system and address any issues quickly and efficiently.

Once stability is confirmed over a 24–48 hour window, we will open up validator participation and share comprehensive setup documentation for everyone.

Thank you for your patience and support as we ensure a smooth and stable launch.
