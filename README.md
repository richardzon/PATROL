## Great Security Starts With Great Coverage
Patrol's mission started after the Bittensor summer attacks where we saw $20M+ stolen from TAO holders, members of our Bittensor community.  

Our mission, simply put, is to secure crypto funds and provide all holders peace of mind, wherever they are.

Patrol is our first step in harnessing Bittensor to collect large volumes of live data which in later stages will be analyzed and used to prevent hacks. 


## Building a Decentralized Palantir
In Patrol, miners and validators work together to intelligently collect large volumes of data from various data sources. It lays the foundation for advanced security intelligence by creating a knowledge graph that maps relationships and behaviours, aiding in investigations, threat detection, and risk assessment.
 
The first data source we‚Äôre covering is in our own backyard: The Bittensor chain. But this is just the beginning as we plan to expand to many other chains as well as other types of data sources like social media, code repos, phishing websites, and more. Ultimately, our goal over time is to build a unified graph of relationships for every crypto wallet that shows all its relationships. 


## Who Needs Patrol?

One of the key lessons from the Bittensor summer attacks is that tracing footprints after the fact takes A LOT of time and is VERY costly. And when it comes to crypto theft investigation, time is of the essence. The longer it is from time of attack the less likely one is to recover funds.

The footprint graph that Patrol creates is a must-have for any security team, investigator and platform developing and solving crypto security.  

## Accessing Patrol's Data
Soon after Patrol launches we plan to provide a Public API for developers interested in consuming the data collected by the Patrol subnet.

## How Patrol Works

### Validator selects target wallet to cover
The flow of the subnet begins with validators selecting target wallets to submit to miners.  These targets are randomly selected from the chain. The [validator](src/patrol/validation/validator.py) then sends a target to each [miner](src/patrol/mining/miner.py). 
[See full target selection code here](src/patrol/validation/target_generation.py)

### Miner builds subgraph for target wallet
[Miners](src/patrol/mining/miner.py) receive the target from the validator and begin their search for related data.  Miners construct a *subgraph* of relational data for the target, and follow the data trace to expand their subgraph to N degrees of separation from the original target. 

Example:
```python
  target = "5GWzwBegYVwZdRjQwaGAvktpGuYaeUYXnMaoaC5PPcqEBuW2"
  target_block = 5100341

  subgraph_generator = SubgraphGenerator(event_fetcher=fetcher, event_processor=event_processor, max_future_events=50, max_past_events=50, batch_size=50)
  subgraph = await subgraph_generator.run(target, target_block)

  print(subgraph)
```
[See the full miner processing class here](src/patrol/mining/subgraph_generator.py).

The subgraph that miners submit is composed of:

- **Nodes**: Representing the entities in the subgraph (wallets, etc)
- **Edges**: Representing relationships between nodes like transactions and staking (exapnding to include parent-child relationships as part of the roadmap).
- **Evidence**: Supporting data to verify the nodes and edges

These subgraphs are then submitted to the validator for evaluation.


### Validator verifies miner‚Äôs subgraph

Once miners submit their subgraphs, [Validators](src/patrol/validation/validator.py) will [verify](src/patrol/validation/graph_validation/bittensor_validation_mechanism.py) the data by checking the *evidence* against the *node* and *edge* data submitted by the miners. This validation is pass/fail, failing will result in a score of 0 for that submission. This verification process currently supports the following node and edges types:

Nodes:
- Wallet nodes: Contains wallet addresses and types.

Edges:
- Transaction edges: Direct token transfers between wallets
- Staking edges: Staking relationships between wallets

See [here](src/patrol/protocol.py) for more details on the supported node and edge types.

### Validator scores subgraph

Once the data has been verified, validators will calculate a *score* for the miner based on the following criteria:
- **Volume** (90%): Amount of valid data submitted, with reasonable caps
- **Responsiveness** (10%): How quickly the miner can submit data
- **Novelty** (will be implemented soon) : How unique the data returned by the miner is.

```python
   volume = len(payload.nodes) + len(payload.edges)
        volume_score = self.calculate_volume_score(payload)
        responsiveness_score = self.calculate_responsiveness_score(response_time)

        overall_score = sum([
            volume_score * self.importance["volume"],
            responsiveness_score * self.importance["responsiveness"]
        ])

```
[View detailed overview of incentive mechanism here](docs/incentive.md).

Ultimately, the mission for each miner is to achieve the highest coverage score by delivering data that is high quality, high quantity, and novel. By doing so, miners ensure that only top-tier data is presented to validators, fortifying a comprehensive and dynamic knowledge graph. This invaluable resource is pivotal for a wide array of security applications, driving the future of digital asset protection and intelligence.
